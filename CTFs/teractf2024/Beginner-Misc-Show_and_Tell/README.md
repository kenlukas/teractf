# Show and Tell

## OSINT

### Show and Tell Just a game I play When I want to hide  (a flag).  So show me and tell me that you read me too.

#### Debrief: If you cut and pasted from the newsletter, the flag wasn't accepted.  I had to create a second flag with the pasted version.  The binary for the flag files looked identical so  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

In the InfoSec newsletter there was a flag disclosed as an "example" flag.
