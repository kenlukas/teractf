# Teradata CTF 2025

## Walkthrough of all the challenges from the CTF 

### Winners!!!

- Eric Pittman (disqualified because I went all Dumbledore and wrote a rule saying you can't win two years in a row and backdated it...MAGIC!)
- Brenda Freeman (So smart...scary smart)
- Mykhailo Klunko (What a surge at the end)
- Joshua Tucker (he had the lead for a little bit late in the day before a prior commitment nuked his chance to win)

NOTE: Prior commitments on CTF day shouldn't happen, this will not be tolerated in the future ðŸ˜‰
