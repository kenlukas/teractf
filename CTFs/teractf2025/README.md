# Teradata CTF 2025

## Walkthrough of all the challenges from the CTF 

### Winners!!!

- Eric Pittman (NOTE: Eric is disqualified from the podium because I went all Dumbledore and wrote a rule saying you can't win two years in a row and backdated it...MAGIC!  The new rule also states he will be known as "His Royal Highness, King of the CTF" until some userper comes along.)
- Brenda Freeman (So smart...scary smart)
- Mykhailo Klunko (What a surge at the end)
- Joshua Tucker (he had the lead for a little bit late in the day before a prior commitment nuked his chance to win)

NOTE: Prior commitments on CTF day shouldn't happen, this will not be tolerated in the future ðŸ˜‰
