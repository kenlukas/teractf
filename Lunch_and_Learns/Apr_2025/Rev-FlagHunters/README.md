# Flag Hunters

## Reverse Engineering

### Lyrics jump from verses to the refrain kind of like a subroutine call. There's a hidden refrain this program doesn't print by default. Can you get it to print it? There might be something in it for you.

This is the Python source code:

```python
import re
import time


# Read in flag from file
flag = open('flag.txt', 'r').read()

secret_intro = \
'''Pico warriors rising, puzzles laid bare,
Solving each challenge with precision and flair.
With unity and skill, flags we deliver,
The ether’s ours to conquer, '''\
+ flag + '\n'


song_flag_hunters = secret_intro +\
'''

[REFRAIN]
We’re flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,
No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.
With every exploit we trigger, every byte we decrypt,
We’re chasing that victory, and we’ll never quit.
CROWD (Singalong here!);
RETURN

[VERSE1]
Command line wizards, we’re starting it right,
Spawning shells in the terminal, hacking all night.
Scripts and searches, grep through the void,
Every keystroke, we're a cypher's envoy.
Brute force the lock or craft that regex,
Flag on the horizon, what challenge is next?

REFRAIN;

Echoes in memory, packets in trace,
Digging through the remnants to uncover with haste.
Hex and headers, carving out clues,
Resurrect the hidden, it's forensics we choose.
Disk dumps and packet dumps, follow the trail,
Buried deep in the noise, but we will prevail.

REFRAIN;

Binary sorcerers, let’s tear it apart,
Disassemble the code to reveal the dark heart.
From opcode to logic, tracing each line,
Emulate and break it, this key will be mine.
Debugging the maze, and I see through the deceit,
Patch it up right, and watch the lock release.

REFRAIN;

Ciphertext tumbling, breaking the spin,
Feistel or AES, we’re destined to win.
Frequency, padding, primes on the run,
Vigenère, RSA, cracking them for fun.
Shift the letters, matrices fall,
Decrypt that flag and hear the ether call.

REFRAIN;

SQL injection, XSS flow,
Map the backend out, let the database show.
Inspecting each cookie, fiddler in the fight,
Capturing requests, push the payload just right.
HTML's secrets, backdoors unlocked,
In the world wide labyrinth, we’re never lost.

REFRAIN;

Stack's overflowing, breaking the chain,
ROP gadget wizardry, ride it to fame.
Heap spray in silence, memory's plight,
Race the condition, crash it just right.
Shellcode ready, smashing the frame,
Control the instruction, flags call my name.

REFRAIN;

END;

If you run this code it takes forever!  It's definitely a slow dance song.  Second, it skips over the part of the song that has the flag!

Going through the source code.

The first loop goes through all the lines of the "song", if it finds the `startLabel` it sets the `start` variable to i + 1.  It also finds `[REFRAIN]` and sets the refrain variable to i+1.  Finally it sets the refrain_return variable to i when it finds `RETURN`

If you print the variables after the loop you'll find:

```sh
start = 16
refrain = 8
refrain_return = 13
```

If we go through, Line 8 is the first line after [REFRAIN], Line 13 is the first RETURN, and Line 16 is the first VERSE line.

The first thing that strikes me as unusual is the for loop that splits on `;`  In Linux, the ; is the symbol to start a new command.

The next line that interests me is the CROWD line.  It takes `input` and doesn't do any sanitization.  This is where we can inject something.

Finally, The RETURN line is interesting.  First, it triggers only if RETURN has a digit after it.  There is only one RETURN in the file and it doesn't have a number.  When it does have a number, that number is assigned to the next line to go to.

Based on the split, any line that has a semicolon will be split in two and the loop will run twice, once for each side of the semicolon.  If we were to put a `;RETURN 0` when we have input that should do it.
