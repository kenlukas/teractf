#### SQL Notes

The biggest note is that the author isn't a SQL expert and the notes below reflect that.

- SQL = Structured Query Language
- SQL is officially pronounced like Ess Queue Ell  (but I've always pronounced it like the word sequel)
- SQL commands are generally capitalized but in my experience, SQL clients aren't case sensitive.
- Why are they capitalized then?  One of lifes great mysteries.  I'm told it's for readability, but really, why??
- A semicolon is used to end a statement (in general)
- Database syntax varies
-- A comment in Oracle starts with -- where PostgreSQL can use /* */
