# Bases

## General

### What does this bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 mean? I think it has something to do with bases.

When I get encoded text I immediately think base64.  Base64 was designed to convert binary into a printable characters.

```sh
$ echo "bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1" |base64 -d
l3arn_th3_r0p35
```

This one is a bit unusual that it doesn't come wrapped in the `picoCTF{}` 


**picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}**
