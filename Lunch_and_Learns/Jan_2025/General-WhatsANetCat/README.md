# What's a Net Cat?

## General

### Using netcat (nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org at port 25103 to get the flag? 

In most CTF's you will need to use Netcat at some point.  The syntax will be `nc <domain name> <port>` 

```sh
$ nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 25103
You're on your way to becoming the net cat master
picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_d0c64587}
```

**picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_d0c64587}**
