# March 2025 Lunch and Learn

## Steganography

This month we used UNIX commands presented in the January L&L, like `file`, `cat`, `strings`, and `exiftool`, with some new tools.  

New tools introduced this month were `binwalk`, `stegseek`, `tesseract`, and `hexedit`.

We also used [https://www.dcode.fr/](https://www.dcode.fr/) and [https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to aid in solutions.
