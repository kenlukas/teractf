The earliest recorded use of steganography was in 500 B.C. when a Greek named Histiaeus would shave the head of a slave, tattoo the message on their head, and let there hair grow back.  He would then send the slave with the hidden correspondence to his son-in-law.  The son-in-law would shave the slaves head to reveal the message.  There was also the practice of writing messages on the shaved bellies of rabbits, and then delivering the rabbit as a normal livestock delivery. 

During the Revolutionary War in the United States, a spy would hide secrets in a ball of yarn and then leave the ball at a pick up spot.  This alerted the US troops to British secrets.  During World War I and II, knitting was used to send messages.  Morse code could be added to a pattern, and decoded by the recipient, using knit and purl stitches as dots and dashes.

During the Cold War, Soviet spies had messages hidden inside what appeard to be US coins.  The contents contained one time padded ciphers, and was discovered by a paperboy who after collecting from a customer dropped a coin and it split open revealing its contents.

Today, steganography is used frequently in our digital world.  From hiding easter eggs in games, to placing watermarks on documents, hiding data inside other mediums is a common practice.

I hope this brief introduction to Steganography and its history was useful and entertaining.  Your takeaway, you could be looking at a hidden message and not even know it!
